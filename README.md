# Camellia - A wallpaper dashboard app designed for Bliss OS

"Considered by many to hold the title of the rarest flower in the world"

Camellia is a Wallpaper Manager / Dashboard app for Bliss OS aimed to allow its users a wide variety of wallpaper categories and selections made possible by its content creators. Besides the team offering a handful of hand picked selections, Camellia also offers users the ability to create their own sub categories fed by custom rss and json headers. In the management side of things, Camellia offers the system the ability to manage wallpaper provider apps and live wallpaper apps as well as providing ways to allow rom content creators to share sounds and packs (wallpaper package apps and icon packs) that are trusted and moderated.

Camellia was inspired by my own wallpaper app Drywall as well as the Google Styles app. This allows the users to explore emotion, style and personalization from a different perspective.
